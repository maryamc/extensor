- Added alt tags to all of the images
- Added “id” to “search-engine-optimization” on code line 29 to properly connect div with anchor on line 16
    - all links are working properly and navigate to their desired locations when clicked upon
- Adjusted the formatting of the html to make it look more neat
- Cant seem to find any discrepencies in the style.css file? Everything is working fine, so Im assuming syntax is correct.
